 # Intro
 It's no secret to we something, every once in a while, on occasion, accidently commit a password or api key into git. And it's not secret that instead of doing the right thing, we just delete the password or api key, recommit, and move on with our day only to forget it ever happened. Well, today we're going to find out how easy it is uncover that bad behavior and hopefully convince you to reconsider next time.

 ### Git 101

 For this task, we'll need to know a litle bit about how git works under the hood. While this isn't necessarily important for writing the code (you can 100% program this yourself by just Googling stuff and coping+pasting stackoverflow code), it'll for sure make the code easier to read and understand.

Git is a content-addressable filesystem. It means that at the core of Git is a simple key-value data store. What this means is that you can insert any kind of content into a Git repository, for which Git will hand you back a unique key you can use later to retrieve that content. ([source](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects))

What git really is under the hood is a database of objects (objects in this case refering to unstructured content like files). When you make changes to a project and commit those changes, the changed files are stored as objects along with a bunch of other fancy metadata git uses on top of that. Objects can be either **tags**, **commits**, **trees,** or **blobs. Tags** give labels to **commits**, **commits** contain metadata (e.g. timestamp, author, etc.), **trees** are like file and directory names that hold information about the project structure, **blobs** are the actual content of the files. Both of these object types are stored in git's object database (which you can see for yourself by looking in `.git/objects` )

![layout of how git stores objects](../../assets/images/posts/discover-hidden-secrets-in-git-repos-with-rust-image-3.png)

### Git in Rust

It's no secret that git is written in C which means there is plenty of support for C library like `libgit2`. Luckly, there are rust bindings for `libgit2` in the crate [git2](https://lib.rs/crates/git2) which gives us a nice high level API with types like `Repository`, `Commit`, `Object`, `Odb`, etc. that we can leverage to search for secrets.

### Secrets

An important note, when I say secrets, I mean any sensitive information that you wouldn't want to commit to a public repo (e.g. passwords, api keys, mother's maiden name, etc.). Obviously, we can't check for *everything* so for this, we'll be checking for a subset of secrets, namely:

```json
[ "AWS API Key", "Facebook Oauth", "Generic API Key", "Generic Secret", "GitHub", "Google (GCP) Service-account", "Google Oauth", "Heroku API Key", "PGP private key block", "Password in URL", "RSA private key", "SSH (DSA) private key", "SSH (EC) private key", "SSH (OPENSSH) private key", "Slack Token", "Slack Webhook", "Twilio API Key", "Twitter Oauth" ]
```

### Projects Overview

With all the background knowledge in place, we can combine to create the basic flow for the project. We're going to be giving our utility a git repo as an input, we'll need to get the object database from the git repo, get all of the objects that are blobs, and check each blob for secrets. To check for secrets, we'll use regex and check for matches in the blob's content.

```python
# Pseudocode
secrets = [...]
repo = some_git_repo
objectDB = repo.objects

for object in objectDB:
    for secret in secrets:
        if object.type is Blob && secret in object.content:
            print secret.type
```

The final source code can be found here: [https://github.com/jonaylor89/JAZ](https://github.com/jonaylor89/JAZ)

### Setup

Before starting, go ahead and create a new rust projects with `cargo`.

```bash
cargo new secret_catcher
```

# Scanning Git Blobs

Looking at our pseudocode, it looks like the first thing we need to do it figure our how to ingest a git repository, read its object DB, and somehow iterate over it. As mentioned above, for this, we'll be using the `git2` crate so the first set is adding that to our `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[package]
name = "secret_catcher"
version = "0.0.1"
authors = ["John Naylor <my@email.con>"]
edition = "2021"
description = "Find secrets hidden in commits"
repository = "https://github.com/jonaylor89/JAZ"
license = "MIT"
readme = "README.md"

[dependencies]
git2 = "0.13"
```

Moving to the code, let's start by injesting the git repo:

```rust
use git2::Repository;
use std::ffi::OsString;

fn main() {
    // Get path to git repo via command line args or assume current directory
    let repo_root: String = std::env::args_os()
        .nth(1)
        .unwrap_or_else(|| OsString::from("."));

    // Open git repo
    let repo = Repository::open(&repo_root).expect("Couldn't open repository");

    println!(
        "{} state={:?}",
        repo.path().display(),
        repo.state()
    );
}
```

To make things easier, we can test our code using the git repo for this project:

```bash
cargo run
# Output: /home/johannes/Repos/secrets_catcher/.git/ state=Clean
```

With that bit of code, we're using `git2`'s `Repository` type to serial the git repo. What we need now it to extract the object DB from it. Fortunuately for us, `git2` has some methods that'd make that trivial.

```rust
use git2::Repository;

fn main() {
    // Get path to git repo via command line args or assume current directory
    let repo_root: String = std::env::args_os()
        .nth(1)
        .unwrap_or_else(|| OsString::from("."));

    // Open git repo
    let repo = Repository::open(&repo_root).expect("Couldn't open repository");

    println!(
        "{} state={:?}",
        repo.path().display(),
        repo.state()
    );

    // Get object database from the repo
    let odb = repo.odb().unwrap();

    // Loop through objects in db
    odb.foreach(|oid| {
        println!("{}", oid);
        // Return true because the closure has to return a boolean
        true
    })
    .unwrap();
}
```

Gotta love when things are simple (can't beat Rust's *no-cost abstraction*)

The code above compiles to print all of the git objects to the console. By leveraging the method `odb()` for the `Repository` type, we can a `git2` `Odb` type, that contains a very handle `foreach()` method. With the `foreach()` method, supply a closure that will soon contain the code for seeing if that git object contains any secrets.

For reabilitiy purposes, let's put the code for scanning the object into its own function:

```rust
odb.foreach(|oid| {
    // Get the object from the object's id
    let obj = odb.read(oid).unwrap();
    // Look for secrets in the object
    scan_object(&obj);
    // Return true because the closure has to return a boolean
    true
})
.unwrap();
```

With the function looking something like this:

```rust
use git2::{ObjectType, Object, Oid, Repository};
use std::str::from_utf8;

// ... fn main() {...} ...

fn scan_object(obj: &Object) {
    if obj.kind() != ObjectType::Blob {
        return;
    }

    // Check if the blob contains secrets
    // TODO: check for secrets in commit here!!!
}
```

Raw git objects require a little bit of preprocessing before we can check if they contain secrets as you can see above. First we use `obj.kind()` to see if we're dealing with a `Blob` because that's the only type of git object we care about. Any other object type can be discarded. Next, to extract the raw `Blob` string, we use the `as_blob()` method in conjection with the `from_utf8()` , found in the standard library, to finally get a raw Rust string containing the `Blob` information.

Again, for readability, let's put the code for actually determining if a `Blob` has a secret in it, into its own function.

```rust
fn scan_object(obj: &Object) {
    if obj.kind() != ObjectType::Blob {
        return;
    }

    // Check if the blob contains secrets
    if let Some(secrets_found) = find_secrets(obj.data()) {
        for bad in secrets_found {
            println!(
                "object {} has a secret of type `{}`",
                obj.id(),
                bad
            );
        }
    }
}

// is_bad : if secrets are found in blob then they are returned as a vector, otherwise return None
fn find_secrets(blob: &str) -> Option<Vec<&'static str>> {
    None
}
```

In the updated `scan_objects()` function, we're passing the `Blob` content to a newly created function `find_secrets()` , which we'll be filling in later, and printing a short message to the console if that `Blob` did, in fact, contain secrets.

For a little bit of flair, I went ahead and added some color to the output of the print statements. This is competely optional but it definitely makes it look cooler and is a tad more pleasing to the eyes.

```rust
use ...;

const INFO: &str = "\x1B[32m[INFO]\x1B[0m";
const CRITICAL: &str = "\x1B[31m[CRITICAL]\x1B[0m";

fn main() {
    // ...
    println!(
        "{} {} state={:?}",
        INFO,
        repo.path().display(),
        repo.state()
    );
    // ...
}

fn scan_object(...) {
    // ...
    println!(
        "{} object {} has a secret of type `{}`",
        CRITICAL,
        obj.id(),
        bad
    );
    // ...
}
```

# Finding Secrets with Regex

It seems that now, the only other thing that needs to be implemented is the `find_secrets()` function that gets called in out `scan_objects()` function. There are a few ways to go about doing this but for this project, let's use regex. We'll check every `Blob` we get against a set of regex which will tell us if there is a secret *and* what kind of secret it is. Every "hit" we get, we'll add that secret type to some kind of list and return that list at the end of the function. First, for the exact regex, I found a few other similar projects that use regex to find secrets and frankensteined them into an array of tuples which is our set of rules.

```rust
fn find_secrets(blob: &[u8]) -> Option<Vec<&'static str>> {
    const RULES: &[(&str, &str)] = &[
        ("Slack Token", "(xox[p|b|o|a]-[0-9]{12}-[0-9]{12}-[0-9]{12}-[a-z0-9]{32})"),
        ("RSA private key", "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"),
        ("SSH (OPENSSH) private key", "-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----"),
        ("SSH (DSA) private key", "-----BEGIN DSA PRIVATE KEY-----"),
        ("SSH (EC) private key", "-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----"),
        ("PGP private key block", "-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----"),
        ("Facebook Oauth", "[f|F][a|A][c|C][e|E][b|B][o|O][o|O][k|K].{0,30}['\"\\s][0-9a-f]{32}['\"\\s]"),
        ("Twitter Oauth", "[t|T][w|W][i|I][t|T][t|T][e|E][r|R].{0,30}['\"\\s][0-9a-zA-Z]{35,44}['\"\\s]"),
        ("GitHub", "[g|G][i|I][t|T][h|H][u|U][b|B].{0,30}['\"\\s][0-9a-zA-Z]{35,40}['\"\\s]"),
        ("Google Oauth", "(\"client_secret\":\"[a-zA-Z0-9-_]{24}\")"),
        ("AWS API Key", "AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}"),
        ("Heroku API Key", "[h|H][e|E][r|R][o|O][k|K][u|U].{0,30}[0-9A-F]{8}-[0-9A-F]{4}-[0-9A-F]{4}-[0-9A-F]{4}-[0-9A-F]{12}"),
        ("Generic Secret", "[s|S][e|E][c|C][r|R][e|E][t|T].{0,30}['\"\\s][0-9a-zA-Z]{32,45}['\"\\s]"),
        ("Generic API Key", "[a|A][p|P][i|I][_]?[k|K][e|E][y|Y].{0,30}['\"\\s][0-9a-zA-Z]{32,45}['\"\\s]"),
        ("Slack Webhook", "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T[a-zA-Z0-9_]{8}/B[a-zA-Z0-9_]{8}/[a-zA-Z0-9_]{24}"),
        ("Google (GCP) Service-account", "\"type\": \"service_account\""),
        ("Twilio API Key", "SK[a-z0-9]{32}"),
        ("Password in URL", "[a-zA-Z]{3,10}://[^/\\s:@]{3,20}:[^/\\s:@]{3,20}@.{1,100}[\"'\\s]"),
    ];

    None
}
```

For implementing the actual regex matching, we'll need to get a little fancy since compiling regex is expensive.

It is an anti-pattern to compile the same regular expression in a loop since compilation is typically expensive. (It takes anywhere from a few microseconds to a few **milliseconds** depending on the size of the regex.) Not only is compilation itself expensive, but this also prevents optimizations that reuse allocations internally to the matching engines. ([source](https://docs.rs/regex/1.5.4/regex/#example-avoid-compiling-the-same-regex-in-a-loop))

To work around this issue, we'll be using `Lazy` from the library `once_cell` to ensure our regex is compiled only once.

(Thank you to [Dr-Emann](https://github.com/Dr-Emann) for the PR adding lazy regex compiling)

```rust
use once_cell::sync::Lazy;
use regex::bytes::RegexSet;

// ...

fn find_secrets(blob: &str) -> Option<Vec<String>> {
    const RULES: &[(&str, &str)] = [...];

    // Lazily compile regex set
    static REGEX_SET: Lazy<RegexSet> = Lazy::new(|| {
        RegexSet::new(RULES.iter().map(|&(_, regex)| regex))
            .expect("All regexes should be valid")
    });

    let matches = REGEX_SET.matches(blob);

    if !matches.matched_any() {
        return None;
    }

    Some(matches.iter().map(|i| RULES[i].0).collect())
}
```

And with the `find_secrets()` function done, we can go ahead and test our code! Again, the easier way is to just test it against the git repo that you're using for the project:

# Conclusion

At this point, we've succeeded at what we set out to create. I went ahead and scanned common testing repositories for this sort of thing like [Plazmaz/leaky-repo](https://github.com/Plazmaz/leaky-repo) and [dijininja/leakyrepo](https://github.com/digininja/leakyrepo). In general the program found all or most of the secrets. In the case of dijininja/leakyrepo it found a lot of RSA private keys which is acceptable but technically a misidentification. For Plazmaz/leaky-repo we find the majority of the keys although once again misidentify some. The decision to use rust makes performance really solid. A couple good extensions to this to help with that could be adding a thread pool in order to scan objects in parallel. In more professional code, it seems more idiomatic for the `scan_objects()` function to return some objects of objects including their results rather than just printing the one containing secrets. For example, it could be formatted something like this:

```json
{
  "objectID1": [ "secrets1", "..." ],
  "...": "..."
}
```

In the end, this tool could work as a good starting point for something more sophisticated.
