<div class="poem">

Hear now, hall-dwellers, of handle-hunting,
of name-seekers stalking the net's night-sea;
Rust-forged finder, fearlessly faring,
through link and ledger, through ghosted domains.

Then rose a reed-voice, wrathful and wanting:
"Give me the .exe! Grant me the click!"
But code is a kiln, and craft is a proving
build it, bold one, and be the smith.
