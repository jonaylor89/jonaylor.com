# Introduction

I do 90% of my work at cafés regardless of whether I’m out of town or 10 minutes from the office and because I’ve just hit my one year mark of living in Williamsburg, Brooklyn I feel qualified enough to talk about and rank the various cafés here. This doesn’t necessarily mean rating cafés by how good they are for traditional coworking; in fact some of the cafés are pretty terrible for coworking but have incredible vibes for ideating! With that being said, I've created a [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HjN_S1Wend7f3JaQNCXcg6KjDQmacJTNh6BpFqOxfF4/edit?usp=sharing) to rank the cafes by various attributes you can see below.

Am I missing any? Is there something important I'm not judging them on? Let me know. There's a few I know I need to visit in the area but what about the other boroughs? Feel free to send me emails or DMs of other cafes with good vibes, good coffee, or good coworking.
