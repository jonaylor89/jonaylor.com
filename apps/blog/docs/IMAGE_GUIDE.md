# Blog Image Implementation Guide

## ✅ Complete Image System

Your blog now supports both **cover images** and **inline images** with full SEO optimization and performance features.

## 📸 Cover Images

Cover images appear on both the homepage (in post previews) and individual post pages as hero images.

### Adding Cover Images to Posts

Add these fields to your post frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2024-01-20"
excerpt: "Post description"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
coverImage: "/images/covers/your-image.jpg"
coverImageAlt: "Descriptive alt text for accessibility"
---
```

### Cover Image Best Practices

- **Dimensions**: 800x400px (2:1 aspect ratio) recommended
- **Format**: JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency
- **File Size**: Keep under 200KB for optimal performance
- **Location**: Store in `/public/images/covers/`
- **Alt Text**: Always provide descriptive alt text for accessibility

## 🖼️ Inline Images (Within Post Content)

For images within your post content, use the custom `BlogImage` component or `ImageGallery` for multiple images.

### Single Images with BlogImage

```mdx
<BlogImage
  src="/images/posts/example.jpg"
  alt="Description of the image"
  caption="Optional caption text"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>
```

### Image Galleries with ImageGallery

```mdx
<ImageGallery
  images={[
    {
      src: "/images/posts/image1.jpg",
      alt: "First image description",
      caption: "Caption for first image"
    },
    {
      src: "/images/posts/image2.jpg",
      alt: "Second image description",
      caption: "Caption for second image"
    }
  ]}
  columns={2}
/>
```

### Gallery Options

- `columns`: Choose between 2, 3, or 4 columns
- Responsive: Automatically adjusts for mobile devices
- Hover effects: Images scale slightly on hover

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Basic Cover Image Post

```yaml
---

date: "2024-01-25"
excerpt: "Building something awesome"
tags: ["project", "development"]
coverImage: "/images/covers/project-cover.jpg"
coverImageAlt: "Screenshot of the project interface"
---

# My Latest Project

This is where your post content begins...
```

### MDX Post with Inline Images

```mdx
---
title: "Tutorial: Building a React App"
date: "2024-01-25"
excerpt: "Step-by-step tutorial"
tags: ["react", "tutorial"]
coverImage: "/images/covers/react-tutorial.jpg"
coverImageAlt: "React logo and code editor"
---

# Building a React App

Let's start with the basic setup:

<BlogImage
  src="/images/posts/react-setup.png"
  alt="Terminal showing Create React App command"
  caption="Initial project setup with Create React App"
/>

Here's what the file structure looks like:

<ImageGallery
  images={[
    {
      src: "/images/posts/file-structure.png",
      alt: "Project file structure",
      caption: "Clean project organization"
    },
    {
      src: "/images/posts/package-json.png",
      alt: "Package.json contents",
      caption: "Dependencies and scripts"
    }
  ]}
  columns={2}
/>
```

## 🔄 Migration from Other Platforms

When migrating from platforms like Hashnode:

1. **Download Images**: Save all images from your existing posts
2. **Organize Files**: Place in appropriate `/public/images/` subdirectories
3. **Update References**: Change image URLs to local paths
4. **Add Alt Text**: Ensure all images have proper alt text
5. **Convert to MDX**: Use `.mdx` extension for posts with custom components

Your blog now has a complete, SEO-optimized image system that's fast, accessible, and easy to use!
