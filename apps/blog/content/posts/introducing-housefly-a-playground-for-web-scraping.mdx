Web scraping is an essential skill for developers, but learning it can be tricky. Thatâ€™s why I created [**Housefly**](https://housefly.cc), a hands-on project designed to teach web scraping through interactive exercises. Inspired by [Google Gruyere](https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/), Housefly provides a series of small tutorials with dedicated companion websites built *to be scraped*. The goal? To give you a safe, structured environment to practice and refine your scraping skills.

## Why Did I Make This?

Iâ€™ve seen countless tutorials that explain web scraping in theory, but very few offer real, controlled environments to experiment in. Housefly solves that by providing self-contained challenges where you scrape provided websites and verify your solutions against expected outputs. Itâ€™s built for hands-on learners who want to *do* rather than just *read*.

## How to Get Started

The few chapters are [live](https://www.housefly.cc/posts/section-1), and you can try it out today!
  - Clone the GitHub repo:
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/jonaylor89/housefly.git cd housefly
```
- Navigate to Chapter 1 and explore the provided website.
- Write your scraper in `apps/solution1/`.
- Run the checker to validate your solution:

```sh
npm run ca 1
```

More chapters are on the way, but for now, dive into the first challenge and start scraping!
