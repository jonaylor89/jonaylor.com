## Turning Google Sheets into a Database with Go

So when I worked at my university’s IT department during college, getting an actual database required a lot of red tape. Because of this, it was very common for us to build apps that used Google sheets as a database (which is really fkn cursed). I wish this were a joke but *everything* was backed by some random Google sheet with like 80k rows in it. For example, I built a little script for setting up new desktop computers in computer labs. We needed a single binary that would run on all the machines and that would use google sheets as a DB.
As much as I hate this, I have a feeling it’s not uncommon so I vibe-coded a little Go lib for it called `sheetsql` ([https://github.com/jonaylor89/sheetsql](https://github.com/jonaylor89/sheetsql)).

> Is this unique?

probably not, I’m sure there’s a million of these

> Can this be used in production?

if you’re using google sheets in production then does it really matter?

### Why Go?
- **Single binary**: no runtime dependencies, ship it and forget it.
- **Cross-compiling**: build for Linux, Windows, macOS with ease. ideal for mixed‑environment labs.

### Setup: Google Sheets creds
- Create a Google Cloud service account, download its JSON key.
- Share your sheet with the service account email ([xxx@yyy.iam.gserviceaccount.com](mailto:xxx@yyy.iam.gserviceaccount.com)).
- Configure the `Client` to point at the sheet ID and keyfile.

### Try it out

isn’t it beautiful

**In short**: if you ever need a quick SQL‑like layer on top of Sheets, **sheetsql** is *a* solution. no red tape, no DB admin required
