# **Stages**

## **Premier Stage (Birth — Puberty) ≈ (0–12)**

- Parents/guardians must be present during a majority of learning
- Children are exposed to a variety of topics with the hope for them to become interested in one or a few

## **Defining Stage (Puberty) ≈ (12–16)**

- Students pick a general field of study to get more involved with
- The parents, although still important, become less of a factor in the student’s education making way for the community as a whole to become the student’s guide.

## **Cooperative Stage (Puberty — Adulthood) ≈ (16–20)**

- Learning is split between hands-on work with the community (Similar to how modern society today has internships and co-ops) and thought experiments in groups and individually
- Professional mentors in the topic of the student’s choosing will be pivotal in integrating the students into professional life

# **Society’s Roles**

Education and society are directly related. A complete reconstruction of the public educational system cannot happen without a complete reconstruction of society. The proposed system for teaching the future generations revolves heavily on more interconnected communities. There are no “teachers” or “administrators” because everyone is a teacher and the community as a whole administers the education of their youth. The way society is structured today with its competitive atmosphere and bureaucratic, inhuman nature would make this proposed system virtually impossible.

# **Creativity**

## **Conceptual Understanding of Topics**

A conceptual understanding of topics and subjects of study will be far more emphasized than memorization of arbitrary facts and specific equations. By having students understand concepts rather than facts, individuals would be able to more easily contribute new ideas. One doesn’t necessarily need every fact or equation about a subject to be able to brainstorm about it, one only needs to understand the concept of the subject.

## **Thought Experiments**

To boost student’s creativity, extensive time will be allocated for individual and group thought experiments where students will have the opportunity to come up with new and innovative ideas.
