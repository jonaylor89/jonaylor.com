# Introduction

I do 90% of my work at cafés regardless of whether I’m out of town or 10 minutes from the office and because I’ve just hit my one year mark of living in Williamsburg, Brooklyn I feel qualified enough to talk about and rank the various cafés here. This doesn’t necessarily mean rating cafés by how good they are for traditional coworking; in fact some of the cafés are pretty terrible for coworking but have incredible vibes for ideating.
