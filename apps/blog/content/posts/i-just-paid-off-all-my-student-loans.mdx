### some backstory

I never wanted to go to college—which, I know, is a cliché—but with some of my friends from governors school in Virginia getting 6 figure jobs doing React development straight out of high school, why the hell would I throw myself in debt for nothing? Regardless, there was no chance I could get that logic through my mom. She doesn’t normally act like a stereotypical immigrant parent except when it comes to academics. In protest, I applied to only 1 (*one*) university.

Virginia Commonwealth University was 1) in Virginia and thus in-state and 2) not in a college town and thus when I inevitably got bored of school ([exempli gratia](https://youtu.be/juIu87o6RU0)), there were other things to do. I started college in 2017 and managed to get out by 2021 during COVID with both a bachelors and masters in computer science. I’m fortunate also to have had a guaranteed job lined up at Capital One after graduation that started me off at 6 figures. Ironically doing Vue (as well as [other fun things](https://www.capitalone.com/tech/machine-learning/create-wine-recommender-using-nlp/)) instead of React so things almost come full circle. I’m a firm believer that college is worthless for most people but whatever, my 20s were off to a good start.

Fast forward a few of years and, like many people my age, the time comes to start making payments on student loans. While I was very fortunate to have gotten a considerable amount of help from the Military, Veterans Affairs, duel enrollment credits from governors school, as well as many many other places, I nonetheless had loans that needed repaying. At first my mom agreed to pay (I’m a child, I can’t pay student loans. wtf is interest??). I couldn’t play the child-card forever though and after a couple years I agreed to take on the loans. That’s all fine and good but for folks who’ve been close with me know, I’ve had a very…[tumultuous financial situation](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/T_4OoVBWIDE) the past few years going between tech start ups. To the point, the biggest stressor I had while founding and running Tapped Ai was those damn student loan payments.

### now

This brings us to this past weekend. If finance is about booms and busts, peaks and troughs, I’d say I’m at a peak. With that, I made the decision to *pull trig* and pay off **all** my student loans in one big payment. I could’ve bought a house with cash, I could’ve bought my friends and I new cars, I could’ve fucked off to somewhere warm for a few years. Instead, I paid off my student loans. As of now (or whenever the payments clear) **I am debt free**.
